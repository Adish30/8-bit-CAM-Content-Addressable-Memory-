# 8-bit-CAM-Content-Addressable-Memory-
8 bit CAM using 1 bit CAM simulated in  Dsch2

The project focuses on the design and performance analysis of a simple 8-bit CAM circuit. The circuit is simulated using DSCH2 software. The 8-bit CAM can be implemented with either NAND gates or transmission gates (CMOS).

The main aim of the project is to become familiar with memory systems and the DSCH2 software.

The DSCH program is a logic editor and simulator used to validate the architecture of logic circuits before beginning microelectronics design.
